# Binary Classification Research Project with GNN üìäüß†

## Project Overview üåê

Welcome to the Binary Classification Research Project repository! This repository represents a journey of exploration and innovation in the realm of binary classification using Graph Neural Networks (GNN). Our goal is to enhance accuracy and interpretability in binary classification, drawing inspiration from the [**DeepReflect: Discovering Malicious Functionality through Binary Reconstruction**](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21fall-downing.pdf). paper and utilizing the power of GNNs and the XAI. But DR used auto-encoder approach and we are using GNN instead , they have used binary ninja disassmebler and we used idapro, r2pipe etc, PE python libraries etc . 

## Contents üìÇ

- `cfg_generator_ida.py`: Script to generate control flow graphs (CFG) using IDA Pro for input binary data.
- `testing.py`: Comprehensive script with various implementations, including r2pipe methods to convert assembly to CFG, along with other tools for transforming assembly or executable files to CFG.
- `Linux_json.json` and `windows_json.json`: JSON files containing sample data (private) for Linux and Windows environments.
- `README.md`: You're currently reading this file!
